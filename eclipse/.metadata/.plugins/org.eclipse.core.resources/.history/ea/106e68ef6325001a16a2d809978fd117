							<p style="color:white">Players will be rewarded in-game cosmetics by achieving certain community support goals. (for example, creating or administrating large DNC servers, advertising DNC on youtube, etc...). To claim an in-game cosmetic reward please email us at <a>disckord35@gmail.com</a> with your <i>exact in-game username</i> and proof of your community role/achievement and your in-game cosmetic effect will activate within a couple days.</p>
							<p style="color:white">Players can also be rewarded in-game cosmetic effects when donating to DNC. (see our <a href="donate.html">donation page</a>). When donating you will be given a cosmetic effect based on your amount donated, with higher amounts being rewarded with effects such as <i>flames (includes fire sound effect), cherry blossom leafs, </i>and lower amounts being rewarded with effects such as <i>smoke, steam, bubbles(includes bubble sound effect) and lava/water drops.</i> See our <a href="donate.html">donation page</a> for a full list of obtainable cosmetic rewards at different donator ranks.</p>

								<p>Everything you need to know about dnc</p>
							</header>
							<p style="color:white">Disckords nostalgia client (DNC) was created by disckord initially as a passion project. Disckord wanted to create a client that would provide the best way to experience classic minecraft. With the look, feel and mechanics of older versions of minecraft, dnc incorporates newer features and quality of life such as sprinting, server lists, breeding, weapon/armor upgrates etc. DNC also has added features such as Ted-80's world generation, optional alpha aesthetics and optifine for 1.5.2 (shader support).</p>
						
						<p style="color:white">DNC is established to make all hack clients currently available redundant, using complex obfuscation and private source code. This means a vanilla dnc server will never need an anti-cheat plugin. Rest assured knowing you wont be x-rayed or esp'd ever again. There will not be any cheats made for DNC for a very, very long time.</p>
						
						<p style="color:white">DNC automatically updates every time you launch the game. Similarly to official versions of minecraft. The server will have to be re-downloaded every update. Players with a different version to the server will not be able to join and will be told their client or server is out of date. In the launcher you will find newest patch notes and notifications if your launcher is out of date. </p>
